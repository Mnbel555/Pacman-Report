## Introduction
Pac-Man is an action maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts—Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange)—who pursue Pac-Man.

## Mechanism 
The main objective of Pac-Man is to navigate through a maze, eating all the dots while avoiding being caught by ghosts. If Pac-Man touches a ghost, he loses a life.

### Objective
Eat all dots while avoiding ghosts.

### Components
- Pac-Man: Player-controlled character
- Ghosts: Enemy characters
- Dots and Power Pellets: Collectible items

### Gameplay
- Control Pac-Man with arrow keys.
- Eat dots to score points.
- Avoid ghosts; they end the game if touched.
- Eating power pellets allows Pac-Man to eat ghosts temporarily.
  
## Instructions 
"To play Pac-Man, use the W,A,S,D keys to control Pac-Man's movement through the maze. The objective is to eat all the dots scattered throughout the maze while avoiding contact with the ghosts. If Pac-Man touches a ghost, the game ends. However, eating power pellets will temporarily turn the ghosts blue and make them vulnerable, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for extra points. Keep an eye on your score as you gobble up dots and ghosts to see how well you're doing.
